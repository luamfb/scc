If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes
by L/c^2. The fact that the energy withdrawn from the body becomes energy of
radiation evidently makes no difference, so that we are led to the more general
conclusion that
The mass of a body is a measure of its energy-content; if the energy changes by
L, the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 * 1020, the energy being measured
in ergs, and the mass in grammes.
It is not impossible that with bodies whose energy-content is variable to a
high degree (e.g. with radium salts) the theory may be successfully put to the
test.
If the theory corresponds to the facts, radiation conveys inertia between the
emitting and absorbing bodies.
(Albert Einstein, 1905)
