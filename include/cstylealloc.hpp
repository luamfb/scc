// This is meant for SCC internal use, but you can use it as well.
// It gaps the bridge between C and C++ allocators.
// The function it recieves as parameter should try to allocate memory, and
// return NULL (ie, 0) in case of failure.
//
// Notes:
// - you can only use this with actual functions, not with macros like
// SDL_LoadBMP (use the *_RW counterpart instead)
// - the Deleter type cannot be automatically deduced, which is why it's
// been put in a template class, but all other types can, which is why they've
// been put in the template function
//
template <typename Deleter>
struct CStyleAlloc {

	// Notes:
	// - I chose to recieve f as a template parameter, rather than an
	// std::function or similar, because of forwarding issues, namely:
	// what's f's signature? It can't be f(Args ...), because deduction
	// would fail with lvalues (forwarded as lvalue references), and it
	// can't be f(Args&& ...) because that only works if the real f only
	// recieves rvalue references as arguments.
	// The quickest workaround is not to specify f's signature at all.
	//
	// - ideally, this should create an alias to the type T the first time
	// it appears (in the middle of alloc's return type), but I don't think
	// it's possible
	//
	// - we don't check f with std::is_function because that would refuse
	// several viable functions, such as function pointers and lambdas. But
	// f still has to be callable, or else you may get undefined behaviour:
	// "As formulated in C++11, the behavior of std::result_of is undefined
	// when INVOKE(std::declval<F>(), std::declval<ArgTypes>()...) is
	// ill-formed (e.g. when F is not a callable type at all). C++14 changes
	// that to a SFINAE"
	// (<en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/result_of>)

	// Lo, and behold: C++ templates in all their majesty!
