==== NOW =====
Classes for opengl shaders and objects (VAO, VBO, etc)
	- make a macro to disable those if user doesn't want them
	- have to be move-only: see <https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Common_Mistakes#RAII_and_hidden_destructor_calls>

Store a reference to the Renderer in the Window upon creating it, to ensure
a functionality similar to SDL_GetRenderer()

Now that Renderer isn't a member of Window anymore, implement old-style render
Load Surface from non-bitmap image (named constructor idiom)

SDL_GL: bind/unbind texture
	"You need a renderer to create a SDL_Texture, therefore you can only use
	this function with an implicit OpenGL context from SDL_CreateRenderer(),
	not with your own OpenGL context. If you need control over your OpenGL
	context, you need to write your own texture-loading methods."

==== LATER ====
TrueTypeFont should have all the functionailty from SDL_ttf
SDL_mixer sound effects stuff
