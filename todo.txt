==== NOW =====
Remove the GL classes; there are better openGL C++ wrappers out there
	- also remove USE_GL_CLASSES from config.hpp
Make library header only
	- meaning it won't make sense to have those HAVE macros declared on
	config.hpp
	- also meaning SCC headers shouldn't pull SDL.h or other SDL headers
	- also meaning the tests' makefiles must be changed
scc.hpp should check (through version macros) if sdl_image, mixer, ... was
actually included if its repsective have macro have been declared

Now that Renderer isn't a member of Window anymore, implement old-style render
Load Texture from bitmap (through Surface; named constructor idiom)

==== LATER ====
SDL_GL: bind/unbind texture
	"You need a renderer to create a SDL_Texture, therefore you can only use
	this function with an implicit OpenGL context from SDL_CreateRenderer(),
	not with your own OpenGL context. If you need control over your OpenGL
	context, you need to write your own texture-loading methods."
	<https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_BindTexture>
TrueTypeFont should have all the functionailty from SDL_ttf
SDL_mixer sound effects stuff
