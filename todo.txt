==== NOW =====
The user shouldn't need to define the HAVE* macros when we can define them
instead, based on which version macros are available at the moment scc.hpp was
included

Rewrite config test

Rewrite README with right usage info (the user has to include any SDL headers
before including scc.hpp)

Now that Renderer isn't a member of Window anymore, implement old-style render
Load Texture from bitmap (through Surface; named constructor idiom)

A demo folder

==== LATER ====
SDL_GL: bind/unbind texture
	"You need a renderer to create a SDL_Texture, therefore you can only use
	this function with an implicit OpenGL context from SDL_CreateRenderer(),
	not with your own OpenGL context. If you need control over your OpenGL
	context, you need to write your own texture-loading methods."
	<https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_BindTexture>
TrueTypeFont should have all the functionailty from SDL_ttf
SDL_mixer sound effects stuff
