==== NOW =====
Makefiles don't rebuild $(OBJ) when the source is newer

The FIXME in GL/common.hpp

Now that Renderer isn't a member of Window anymore, implement old-style render

Load Texture from bitmap (through Surface; named constructor idiom)

==== LATER ====
SDL_GL: bind/unbind texture
	"You need a renderer to create a SDL_Texture, therefore you can only use
	this function with an implicit OpenGL context from SDL_CreateRenderer(),
	not with your own OpenGL context. If you need control over your OpenGL
	context, you need to write your own texture-loading methods."
	<https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_BindTexture>
TrueTypeFont should have all the functionailty from SDL_ttf
SDL_mixer sound effects stuff
